# Victoria Clipper GTFS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zacs/victoriaclipper-gtfs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zacs/victoriaclipper-gtfs)

This repository hosts an up-to-date version of transit schedule data for the Victoria Clipper ferry. The data is in the [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/) format.

*[Download the GTFS here](https://github.com/zacs/victoriaclipper-gtfs/releases/latest).*

### TODO

- Add a build script that makes nice geoJSON-based documents in the repo itself.

## History

I based this GTFS feed on one which was built using AddTransit, but has since expired. I've updated the feed (and fixed a couple bugs in it) and put it on GitHub so that others can modify source in the future.
